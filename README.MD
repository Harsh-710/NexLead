# NexLead

## Description

This is a personal Full-Stack project created as a proof of skill. It showcases my proficiency in building web applications using the Express.js framework for the back-end and HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end.

The project includes a `.env` file that contains important configuration variables:

- `MONGO_URI`: This variable holds the connection URI for the MongoDB database. It is used to establish a connection with the database. Please ensure to set it with the appropriate MongoDB URI.

- `JWT_SECRET`: This variable stores the secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in authentication and authorization processes. It ensures the security and integrity of the tokens. Make sure to set a strong and secure secret key.

- `JWT_LIFETIME`: This variable defines the expiration time for JWTs in seconds. It determines how long the tokens remain valid before the user needs to authenticate again. Set an appropriate value based on your desired token expiration policy.

These variables are essential for the proper functioning of the project. Make sure to set them with valid and secure values.
